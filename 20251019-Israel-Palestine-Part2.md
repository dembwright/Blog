### Intro

Since my last post on this topic a lot of confusion has cleared up. The most relevant news is that both parties have agreed to the ceasefire and hostages and prisoners have been swapped. To be clear, both parties have agreed to and completed Phase 1 of the deal - where phase 1 represents the return of hostanges and prisoners, a ceasefire, and withdrawal of Israeli troops to some line, and phase 2 is essentially everything else. I left off last post with a lot of questions and skepticism that this will hold. Now, I don't think a full deal will ever happen, but I also don't think the fighting will ever return to the same level of brutality as before. Splitting the deal into two phases makes a lot of sense to me. The first part had tangible outcomes that can be realized within days (72 hours) whereas the second part had no real structure. There have been a couple of "flare ups" since the deal and most news organizations are stating that these show how brittle the deal is. 

I think there is very straightforward evidence for why this will never hold and no one seems to be talking about it. Immediately after the ceasefire took place, Hamas started to assert its control over the territory with [public executions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30FNJuA16sw) and fought against other [clans and gangs](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/clans-armed-groups-challenging-hamas-gaza-2025-10-14/). Their reasoning? They are working/worked with Israel. Moreoever, the other clans deny this. 

But isn't that the whole point? That Palestinians and Israelis will eventually work together to acheieve peace? How can there ever be peace in the region if 1) Hamas remains in power (a red line for Israel) or 2) all of the other armed groups cannot even admit to working with Israel? For the foreseable future the Palestinians will never have self-governance. 


### Trump's Motivation
Last post I asked, "If the hostages are released, is that enough for Trump to claim victory if fighting continues afterwards?" I think the answer seems to be a yes now. Immediately afterwards, every news station floated the question of whether he should be awarded the nobel peace prize and even the winner [dedicated the prize to him](https://x.com/MariaCorinaYA/status/1976642376119549990). Does he actually plan to lead the "Board of Peace" until he dies? No way. If the fighting continues he can always blame Hamas and just state that they must've never had peaceful intentions.

### Hamas's Motivation
Analysts seemed to have concluded that holding the hostages became more of a liability than an asset. As long has Hamas held on to the hostages, Israel would have a reason for continuing to fight the way it has been. Hamas's one goal since its conception has been the resistance and destruction of Israel. I think it is safe to assume that this aspect has not changed. With the Gaza City offensive happening and hostages as a liability, it was in their best interest to stop the immediate Israeli pressure allowing them to move freely in the region, regroup, restrategize, and assert control. 

Last post I asked, "If Hamas does not agree to disarm, will that cross Israel's red line? Will it cross Trump's?... While a transitionary government assumes control, does Hamas help or is that indirect control?" The core to these questions was to determine how much of buffer exists. And Hamas needed to know as well. They got some approval from Trump to act as temporary police, but as they beceame more brazen with their dominance, Israel must have spoken up and Trump issued a warning for them to tone it down. While a power vaccuum exists, no group really has the capacity, aside from what is remaining of Hamas, to control the region. 

### Israel's Motivation
Facing internal pressure, the government needed a win: get the hostages back. Thy got the win and now they will focus on slowly but surely swiss-cheesing the rest of Palestine. Throughout the war, Israel worked with some of the rival gangs and clans to get info on Hamas and is probably part of their general strategy of divide and conquer. They can shift from using their own troops to control the region to indirect means as Gaza slides into internecine conflict. As phase 2 talks take place, Israel will push for little Hamas involvement. Betting that Hamas will keep resisting the region will stay destabilized and public opinion will start to turn on Hamas again. 

### Conclusion
While the Phase 1 of the deal is an acheievement, phase 2 seems unlikely given the actions of Hamas. While Hamas had great PR during the war, as the intensity subsides, we can start to remember life within their control. With public executions, [using hospitals as military sites](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hamas-gaza-city-jordanian-hospital-19c0c684) and women remaining mostly absent from public celebrations of the ceaseifre, civilians have little to look forward to. Who will fund the reconstruction of the infrastrcuture? Who will work with these different armed groups?
