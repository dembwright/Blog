### Intro
Well the biggest news this week is probably the [US 20 point proposal](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1972726021196562494) to end the Israel-Hamas war. It has pretty [widespread support](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/global-support-for-president-trumps-bold-vision-for-peace-in-gaza/) in the region, notably not Iran, but there still seems to be [hurdles](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hamas-israel-trump-gaza-peace-deal-50643a6d?mod=hp_lead_pos1) in the path forward. While everyone seems to be very optimistic this time around, I have some reservations. When the ceasefire happened at the beginning of the year, and then Hamas [paraded around hostages](https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idRW981208022025RP1/) and throughout Gaza it was a sure bet that it was only going to be temporary. Oddly people seemed surpirsed when the fighting resumed. However, it feels like there is an even greater sense that this time the deal will stick. So will it? This is what I think

### Trump's Motivation
I believe Trump is primarily motivated by his desire to get a Nobel Peace Prize. He's stated that he deserves it before and he's expressed interest in a nomination. Different countries' leaders, at times, have suggested they will [nominate him](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/08/trump-nobel-peace-prize-nomination/85584807007/) with the hopes of getting some deal and sucking up to Trump. If this deal actually sticks, I do think Trump may get the Nobel Peace Prize. I recall hearing somewhere that the Nobel Peace Prize isn't necessarily given to people whom are peaceful themselves, rather, simply try to use diplomacy to solve a crisis. While it may seem like credit to Trump is earned here, I don't think Trump essentially saying 'take this deal or I give Israel the greenlight to wipe you out and I will help them' is a fair negotiation or true diplomacy (it's coercion). At the same time, I always thought that rule number one was No Negotiating With Terrorists. 

This is not the only reason, though. In general he likes to promote the idea that he is a dealmaker and that he is against wars. Remember during his campaign when he suggested that he would [end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours](https://apnews.com/article/trump-russia-ukraine-war-un-election-a78ecb843af452b8dda1d52d137ca893)? He bragged that there were no wars during his first presidency and that these wars only started because Joe Biden is considered week and that they never would have happened had he been in office. So, I think he also wants to show the world, his haters, and his supporters, he _can_ end wars through diplomacy. 

Finally, I think in general everyone is sick of hearing about the atrocities of this war. It represents a dark time in our history and I think we'd all like to permanently leave this in the past. Trump has probably heard enough from people that Netanyahu gets to walk over him.

### Source of My Skepticism
While this deal was cast as a 'take it or leave it' deal, if you've been following Trump's tariffs tactics you'd know that he likes to start at the worst outcome for the person on the other side of the table so that they must coutneroffer ("the art of the deal"). This implies the deal that will actually be reached will only be better for Hamas and worse for Israel. 

### Hamas' Motivations
I think that the main points of the proposal have always been on the table, or at least for well over a year and a half. That is: Hamas, put down your weapons, release the hostages, conceede governance over the region, and Israel will stop. Why stop resisting now? While the Hamas organization has been decimated, a significant number of militants have been recruited since October 7th, 2023. I imagine that this is because Hamas probably ensured some stipend, if your family members were killed you would want revenge, and fighting is a better alternative than sitting in a tent and waiting to die or starve. While these emotions are strong, they are competing with the nostalgia for peace. But this requires insurance that you be given amnesty if you surrender, not a "72 hour truce." 

I believe Hamas is motivated to 1) stay in power and 2) see the destruction of Israel/Jews, rather than a prosperous future of Gazans. They never seemed to care about Palestinians - if they did, they would've spent most of the last two decades building civilian infrastructure instead of planning revenge. Anyway, back to the deal. Just yesterday, Hamas responded to proposed plan. I think they played it smart, but it was risky. By not unconditionally agreeing, they correctly bet he is using his tariff tactics. By agreeing to release the hostages, and conceding governance, they hit the emotional buttons that most people in the world care about. It potentially sets them up to further push the narrative that Israel is motivated by killing Palestinians as opposed to ending the conflict and the return of the hostages. By omitting the other parts of the deal, they want the perception that Israel/US are the ones backing out. It paid off, becuase Trump replied on whatever platform he uses that they were interested in peace and that we were really close to a deal.

### Israel's Moivations
I have a tough time understanding Israel's motivations. My general understanding is that the majority of the public wants the hostages back, and a security guarentee that this kind of attack can never happen again. For the religious extremists, this is all a pretext to realizing the Jewish homeland as in the bible. For the people in power, it is to stay in power and a positive opinion in history books in Israel. Connecting them all: they want to eradicate this kind of threat full stop. To keep cohesion among the different parts, they need to keep doing one thing: they need to keep appeasing Trump. They don't really care about international opionion. I think that this is because of the history of Jews. Jews have been oppressed everywhere for centuries and the idea that "everyone hates them" is nothing new. It is why they have their own country now, and whether or not you are on their side now won't stop them from their decision making process. It's just an ebb and flow of isolationism. The current proposal gives them everything they want, but where is the line they will draw to back out and how does that compare with Trump's? 


### Where This Leaves Us
I don't have much of a conclusion, sorry. There are just different paths for success and failure in this deal and understanding the tensions at play can help us determine what will happen next. For example, If Hamas does not agree to disarm, will that cross Israel's red line? Will it cross Trump's? If it crosses Israel's red line and they decide to resume attacking, will that cross Trump's red line? Does Trump's wish for being percieved as a peacemaker trump Israel's security wishes? Does Trump's wish to be seen as a strongman trump the plight of Gazans? If the hostages are released, is that enough for Trump to claim victory if fighting continues afterwards? While a transiotnary government assumes control, does Hamas help or is that indirect control? What if Hamas is gone and "Hamas 2.0" is born?

I believe this time is different becuase of the support of surrounding nations. In it's current status, though, I don't see it lasting - I need to hear Hamas unequivocally agree to everything, and as Thomas Friedman said, hear Netanyahu agree to it in Hebrew while speaking to the Israeli governemnt.
